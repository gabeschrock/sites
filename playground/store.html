Leo has created a store called Leo's Store of Wonders. He has some items that either cost daily wheel currency, fake money, or both.
</p>
<p>
Leo also appreciates tips.<br/>
His brother, Gabe, has created this website.<br/>
Leo started a store; it evolved into a game and just got more and more complicated.

Leo has gotten a lot of daily wheel currency by buying it, and he uses it to spin the daily wheel.
